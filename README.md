A linked list in C++ is a fundamental data structure used to store and manage a collection of elements. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not require contiguous memory allocation, which makes them dynamic in size. Each element, called a node, contains both data and a pointer to the next node, forming a chain-like structure. This allows for efficient insertions and deletions at any point in the list, although accessing elements may require traversing the list linearly. Linked lists come in various forms, such as singly linked lists (each node points to the next), doubly linked lists (each node points to both the next and the previous), and circular linked lists (where the last node points back to the first). C++ allows for the implementation of linked lists using custom structures or classes, making them a versatile tool for managing data in a flexible and memory-efficient manner.# Linked-list
